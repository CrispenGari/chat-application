### React Native FlatList

In this tutorial we are going to make use of the `FlatList` to render some list on the screen. We are going to use the [Random Data API](https://random-data-api.com/api/company/random_company?size=100) to get some random data. and display them using a flat list.

The goal is to use FlatList instead of the React native `ScrollView` to display data.
